#### *Machine Learning in FinTech*:  
with your group suggest and research one Use case in Fintech, locate some data in this space, explore it a bit, and choose a model you'd like to work with.

**Area of FinTech**:  
(RealTech)


**Dataset researched and located**:  
(Recommended data sources: Kaggle.com ) 

**ML Use Case**:  
House Price Prediction
Predicting a sale price for a house based on the geographical variables (region location and distance from CBD).
Predicting a sale price for a house based on the size of house (ex: number of bedrooms).


**ML model selected**:  
( random forest)

**Reason**: 
Given that the objective of this project is to predict the price of a house, which is a numerical and continuous output, this is a regression task. Therefore, the random forest regression machine learning model is used. While the random forest requires a significant amount of time to train, it provides the best accuracy and ideal prediction. In addition, the data set we chose is large and contains a variety of variables, and the random forest algorithm is well-suited for processing large amounts of data and executing complex tasks.
